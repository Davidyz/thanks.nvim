# thanks.nvim

> Never forget to star a repo

Automatically star all the Neovim plugins you use.

> [!NOTE]  
> Only works with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).  
> Please open an issue or PR if you want to use it with another plugin manager.

## üöÄ Usage

After installing thanks.nvim, you must first log in to GitHub using the `:ThanksGithubAuth` command. This step is necessary only once.

Once you're authenticated, you can star all the installed plugins using the `:ThanksAll` command.  
The initial run may take a minute if you have a lot of plugins, but next runs will be faster due to the utilization of a local cache.  
The local cache can be deleted using the `:ThanksClearCache` command. It will be recreated the next time you execute `:ThanksAll`.

With the default configuration, every time a new plugin is installed, `:ThanksAll` will be automatically executed.

## üîß Requirements and dependencies

-   Linux or MacOs: not tested on Windows but should **NOT** work, PRs are welcome.
-   cURL: if you don't have curl installed, use your favorite plugin manager to install it.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstall

Uninstall the plugin as you normally would, if you want to clean everything, you can delete the cache file and the saved access token:

```sh
rm path/to/jsongerber-thanks.json
```

To find the path of this file, you can run the following command in neovim:

```vim
:lua vim.print(vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/jsongerber-thanks.json")
```

## üé≠ Motivations

Inspired by the VS Code plugin [px to rem & rpx & vw (cssrem)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cipchk.cssrem).  
There is two vim plugin to convert px to \(r\)em but those were missing some feature I wanted such as the virtual text and the nvim-cmp integration:

## üìù TODO (will do if there is demand (open issue or PR))

-   [ ] Other plugin managers
-   [ ] Unstar on uninstall
