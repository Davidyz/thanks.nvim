# thanks.nvim

> Never forget to star a repo

Automatically star all the Neovim plugins you use.readml

> [!NOTE]  
> Only works with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) and [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).  
> Please open an issue or PR if you want to use it with another plugin manager.

## üöÄ Usage

After installing thanks.nvim, you must first log in to GitHub using the `:ThanksGithubAuth` command. This step is necessary only once.

Once you're authenticated, you can star all the installed plugins using the `:ThanksAll` command.  
The initial run may take a minute if you have a lot of plugins, but next runs will be faster due to the utilization of a local cache.  
The local cache can be deleted using the `:ThanksClearCache` command. It will be recreated the next time you execute `:ThanksAll`.

With the default configuration, every time a new plugin is installed, `:ThanksAll` will be automatically executed.

## üîß Requirements and dependencies

-   A plugin manager: [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) or [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
-   Linux or MacOs: not tested on Windows but should **NOT** work, PRs are welcome.
-   cURL: if you don't have curl installed, use your favorite package manager to install it.

## üìã Installation
